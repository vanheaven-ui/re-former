## About <a name = "about"></a>
The project specifications were centered around transitioning from plain HTML forms to using Ruby on Rails form helpers to build the same form as plain HTML. In this repository, the form was created using plain html form elements, then rebuilt using the Ruby on Rails ``form_tag`` helper and ultimately rebuilt using the Ruby on Rails ``form_for`` helper.
